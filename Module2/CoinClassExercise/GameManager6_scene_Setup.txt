How to Set Up the Scene
=======================
Step 1: Create the Coin Prefab
-- Drag the coin model into the Assets folder to create a prefab of the coin.
-- Make sure it has a collider (rigidbody is optional if you want to use physics)


Step 2: Create the SpawnPoints Parent Object and Spawn Points
-- In the Hierarchy, right-click and select Create Empty. Name it SpawnPoints.
   This object will serve as the parent for all your spawn point GameObjects.
-- Inside the SpawnPoints object, create 10 empty GameObjects. To do this, right-click on 
-- pawnPoints and choose Create Empty for each spawn point.
-- Rename them to SP1, SP2, SP3, ..., up to SP10.
-- Position each of the spawn point objects where you want the coins to spawn in the Scene.
-- Ensure all the SP objects (like SP1, SP2, etc.) are children of the SpawnPoints parent object. 
   You should see all the spawn points indented under SpawnPoints in the Hierarchy.



Step 3: Set Up the GameManager6 Script
-- In the Hierarchy, right-click and choose Create Empty to create a new GameObject. 
   Name it GameManager.
-- Attach the GameManager6 Script:


Step 4: Set References in the Inspector
-- Select the GameManager object in the Hierarchy.
-- In the Inspector, you will see the GameManager6 script component with three fields: 
    coinsToCollect, coinPrefab, and spawnPoints
    
-- Drag your coin prefab from the Assets window to the coinPrefab field.
-- Set the size of the spawnPoints array to 10 
-- For each slot in the spawnPoints array, drag and drop each spawn point child 
   (e.g., SP1, SP2, SP3, ..., SP10) 
   from the Hierarchy into the corresponding slot in the array in the Inspector.
   

Note
====
If you wish, you can avoid the dragging and dropping of SP's in GameManager6.cs:

Void Start()
    {
        // Automatically find all child spawn points under the SpawnPoints parent object
        spawnPoints = GameObject.Find("SpawnPoints").GetComponentsInChildren<Transform>();

        // Spawn coins at the spawn points before the game starts
        SpawnCoins();
    }
